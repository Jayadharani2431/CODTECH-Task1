Overview of the project

PROJECT:
    linear regression on housing prices
OBJECTIVE:
    The *objective* of the linear regression project for predicting home prices in machine learning is to build a model that accurately predicts the price of a house based on various
features such as size, number of rooms, location, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to establish a linear relationship between these features and the house prices, allowing the
model to make informed predictions about the price of a house given a specific set of input features. This can help homeowners, buyers, and real estate professionals estimate property 
values based on historical data and trends.
